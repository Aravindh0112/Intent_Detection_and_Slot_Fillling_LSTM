# Intent Detection and Slot Filling using LSTM

This repository contains implementations of models for **Intent Detection** and **Slot Filling**, crucial components in Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The models are trained and evaluated on the **ATIS** and **SNIPS** datasets, which are standard benchmarks for intent detection and slot filling tasks.

## Repository Structure

### Folders
- **LSTM_ATIS**  
  Contains implementation and related files for the LSTM-based model trained on the ATIS dataset.

- **LSTM_SNIPS**  
  Contains implementation and related files for the LSTM-based model trained on the SNIPS dataset.

### Files
- **README.md**  
  The documentation for the repository.

## Features
- **Intent Detection**: Identifies the intent of user queries, such as booking a flight or finding weather information.
- **Slot Filling**: Extracts detailed information from the query, such as dates, locations, and other parameters.

## Datasets
- **ATIS (Airline Travel Information Systems)**: A widely-used dataset for intent detection and slot filling in the travel domain.
- **SNIPS**: Another benchmark dataset with diverse intents from general domains.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aravindh0112/Intent_Detection_and_Slot_Fillling_LSTM.git
